Intelligance and quiz game:
The Plan:
1. The mockup of the Game
2. System Analysis
    a. How many pages to design 
    b.What each page should consist of
    c. What kind of Questions
3. System design
    a. write codes
4. Execute the game
5. Find the errors

## Project Description
In this game there are different types of questions: intelligence, mathematical and others that the player will answer

## Game Logic
Use the DOM to create buttons, input text, labels and other elemments 
For each question there will be 3 or 4 choices for the player to choose 
Use the if statement to decide what actions to execute when the player chooses the correct or the wrong answer
If the answer is correct there are points which will increase each time the answer is correct
if the points are more than 50% the game will congrats the player.
the game may be a one or two player game

### MVP Criteria

- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard is:to work for at least one player 
- it should work and give the congratulations statement for the winner

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline is to make the mockup work
- Another plan is to make sure the game operates as desired
