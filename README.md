# NJIT-SD-03 Milestone Project: Planning

Intelligance and quiz game:
The Plan:
1. The mockup of the Game
2. System Analysis
    a. How many pages to design 
    b.What each page should consist of
    c. What kind of Questions
3. System design
    a. write codes
4. Execute the game
5. Find the errors

## Project Description
In this game there are different types of questions: intelligence, mathematical and others that the player will answer

## Game Logic
Use the DOM to create buttons, input text, labels and other elemments 
For each question there will be 3 or 4 choices for the player to choose 
Use the if statement to decide what actions to execute when the player chooses the correct or the wrong answer
If the answer is correct there are points which will increase each time the answer is correct
if the points are more than 50% the game will congrats the player.
the game may be a one or two player game

### MVP Criteria

- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard is:to work for at least one player 
- it should work and give the congratulations statement for the winner

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline is to make the mockup work
- Another plan is to make sure the game operates as desired

General Requirements
This is a solo project! (Just to clarify, you may do the same game as another student, but you may not work together.)
This game cannot be a game or assignment we've already done in class.
This game must run in a web browser.
This game must be tracked in Github, with a minimum on 10 commits.
Ideally, put your empty project up on Github on day one of development and aim for multiple commits per day.
This game must be deployed on Github Pages or another location.
Game Requirements
The game can be designed for 2 or more players (PvP) or for 1 player (PvE).
The second player in a PvP game can be a person or an AI. (In this case, think of "AI" as a logical pattern.)
For multi-player games, turns should switch appropriately between players
The game should be winnable, or it should keep score (or track player progress in a meaningful way).
When a player wins or loses, the game status and/or score should display visually to the player in a way that does not rely on console.logs or alerts.
If there is a valid draw (tie) condition in your chosen game, that should be implemented.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be written in separate files.
Effort must be spent on styling and appearance.
The HTML code should use sematic tags.
The GitHub repository for your game should have a README.md that describes the inspiration for the game, explains the controls and how to play the game, lists the technologies used to build the game, and addresses any outstanding bugs or unfinished functionality.
